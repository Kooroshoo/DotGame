# DotGame

The game is about testing the gamer’s reaction and coordination. It is based on a 7 times 7 grid of tiles. Every tile is highlighted when the mouse cursor lies within the tiles boundaries. The gamer’s score is displayed at the top left corner of the game. The score displays the clicked dots. Every 2 seconds a green or red dot is randomly spawned on one of the tiles and disappears after 2 seconds again.

If a dot is clicked with the mouse button, the score is updated. Once 11 dots are clicked correctly, the gamer wins and the game and transitions to the Game Over State.
